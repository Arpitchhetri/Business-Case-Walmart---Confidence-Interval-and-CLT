# 🛒 Walmart Black Friday Analysis: Confidence Intervals & Central Limit Theorem

Using statistical methods like **Confidence Intervals** and the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**, we extract insights to support Walmart’s strategic, data-driven decision-making.

## 💡 Business Recommendations

1. **Target Male Shoppers**  
   Male customers spend more per transaction. Design marketing strategies to capitalize on this trend while offering competitive pricing for female-focused products.

2. **Focus on Age Group 26–45**  
   This segment drives the highest volume of purchases. Personalize deals, bundles, and product placements for their needs.

3. **Engage Younger Shoppers (0–17)**  
   Use discounts, gamified rewards, and entry-level products to increase transaction size and build early brand loyalty.

4. **Customer Segmentation Optimization**  
   Customers aged 18–25, 26–35, and 46–50 show similar buying patterns. Tailor campaigns and product lines accordingly. Similarly, group 36–45 and 55+ for unified targeting.

5. **Boost 51–55 Age Group Experience**  
   This age group has the **highest per-transaction spending**. Offer exclusive pre-sale access, loyalty rewards, and personalized product suggestions.
